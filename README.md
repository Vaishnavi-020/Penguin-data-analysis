# Penguin-data-analysis
Started learning seaborn and analyzing data. Here I had tried to analyze the penguin dataset using seaborn.(First dataset analysis using seaborn, there's still lot to learn)

# What I have covered here:
- Analyzed penguin dataset using seaborn where I explored patterns in species, islands, flipper length, body mass, and more.
- Created plots like violinplot, pairplot, regplot, countplot etc.
